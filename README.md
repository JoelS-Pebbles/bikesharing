# Bikesharing

## Overview
I need to convince one of the stakeholders that having a bike-sharing system would be beneficial to the city of Des Moines, Iowa. I made a story in order to solidify my proposal.

## Summary
This is a summary of the bike statistics in NYC. There is a constant trend where it seems that men rent more bikes than women and people who's gender is unknown. The busiest hours for bike rentals seem to be during the weekdays at 8am and between 5pm-6pm. This trend shows in females and males but there is a stronger correlation with the male data. Subscribers make up for more than 3/4 of the total people using these bikes.
